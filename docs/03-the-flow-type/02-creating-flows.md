# Creating Flows

`Flow.succeed` creates a description that succeeds with a value:

```fsharp
let greeting : Flow<string> =
    Flow.succeed "Hello"
```

`Flow.fail` creates an expected typed failure:

```fsharp no-check reason="Application-specific fixtures are described in the surrounding prose"
type LoadError = UserNotFound

let missing : Flow<LoadError, User> =
    Flow.fail UserNotFound
```

Neither value runs when it is created.

Use `Flow.fromTask` or `Flow.fromAsync` when the operation comes from a Task- or Async-returning API and thrown
exceptions are defects:

```fsharp
let readText : Flow<string> =
    Flow.fromTask (fun token -> File.ReadAllTextAsync("message.txt", token))
```

Use an `attempt` constructor when thrown exceptions are expected interop failures that callers should handle:

```fsharp no-check reason="Shown independently; surrounding application context is intentionally omitted"
let readText : ExnFlow<string> =
    Flow.attemptTask (fun token -> File.ReadAllTextAsync("message.txt", token))
```

The distinction is deliberate. `fromTask` preserves an unexpected exception as a defect; `attemptTask` places it in
the typed error channel.

The [Task and Async interop guide](/the-flow-type/task-async-interop.html) covers cancellation and
all supported carriers.

## Go Further

- [Flow construction reference](/api/) lists every constructor and
  conversion.
- [Defects](/error-handling/defects.html) explains when an exception should remain a defect and
  when an attempt constructor is appropriate.
