# Combining Flows

Use `Flow.map` when only the successful value changes:

```fsharp no-check reason="Application-specific fixtures are described in the surrounding prose"
loadUser userId
|> Flow.map _.DisplayName
```

Use `Flow.mapError` when the caller needs a different expected error type:

```fsharp no-check reason="Application-specific fixtures are described in the surrounding prose"
loadUser userId
|> Flow.mapError UserLoadFailed
```

Use `Flow.bind` for dependent work. It is the function form of `let!`:

```fsharp no-check reason="Application-specific fixtures are described in the surrounding prose"
loadUser userId
|> Flow.bind sendGreeting
```

Use `Flow.zip` when two descriptions should run sequentially and both values are needed:

```fsharp no-check reason="Application-specific fixtures are described in the surrounding prose"
Flow.zip loadProfile loadPreferences
// Flow<AppEnv, AppError, Profile * Preferences>
```

`Flow.map2` and `Flow.map3` combine the successful values directly. Concurrent composition is a separate choice;
use `Flow.zipPar` only when both branches are safe to run at the same time.

Prefer `flow {}` for a longer dependent sequence and pipelines for a short transformation. They create the same Flow
model and differ only in how the code reads.

## Go Further

- [Composition reference](/api/) lists mapping, binding, recovery,
  traversal, and sequential combination functions.
- [Fibers](/concurrency-and-state/fibers.html) introduces explicit child workflows.
- [Schedules](/scheduling-and-retries/index.html) adds retry and repetition policies without changing the
  underlying workflow.
