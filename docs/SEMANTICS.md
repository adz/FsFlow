# Semantics

Task-oriented semantics on this page refer to the `FsFlow.Net` package. The core `FsFlow`
package keeps only sync and `Async` concepts in its public surface.

This page describes how FsFlow behaves around failure, exceptions, cancellation,
timeout, and cleanup.

FsFlow does not replace the underlying async or task machinery.
It composes existing `Result`, `Async`, and `.NET Task` behavior behind one workflow type,
while keeping execution explicit through `Flow.toAsync`.

## Success And Typed Failure

- `Flow.succeed value` returns `Ok value`
- `Flow.fail error` returns `Error error`
- `Flow.map` only transforms successful values
- `Flow.mapError` only transforms typed failures

## Exceptions

Use `Flow.catch` to convert exceptions into typed errors.

`Flow.catch` can handle exceptions thrown:

- while building delayed work
- during async execution
- during task execution lifted through `Flow.Task`
- before an awaited async or task boundary produces a value
- after the workflow has already entered async execution

It does not turn ordinary typed failures into exceptions or vice versa unless you ask it to.

## Cancellation

Cancellation is explicit in the execution model:

- `Flow.toAsync environment cancellationToken flow` runs with the supplied token
- `Flow.Runtime.cancellationToken` reads that token inside the flow
- `Flow.Runtime.ensureNotCanceled` checks whether the token is already canceled and returns a typed failure if so
- `Flow.Runtime.catchCancellation` translates `OperationCanceledException` into a typed error

`Flow.Runtime.catchCancellation` handles cancellation thrown while the workflow is already running:

- from `Flow.Runtime.sleep`
- from cold task factories that observe the runtime token
- from task or async work that raises `OperationCanceledException`

`Flow.Runtime.ensureNotCanceled` does not catch exceptions.
It checks the token up front and returns a typed error immediately if cancellation has already been requested.

If a task or async operation ignores cancellation, Flow does not invent cancellation behavior for it.

## Timeout

`Flow.Runtime.timeout after timeoutError flow` returns `Error timeoutError` when the flow does not complete before the timeout.

Timeout does not cancel underlying work by itself. If the underlying work continues independently, it may still complete later.

## Cleanup

- `Flow.tryFinally` runs the compensation action on success, typed failure, and exception
- builder `use` and `use!` dispose resources after the flow body completes
- when a resource implements `IAsyncDisposable`, the builder prefers async disposal
- `Flow.Runtime.useWithAcquireRelease` runs the release action on success, typed failure, exception, and cancellation

## Task Temperature

Task helpers come in two groups:

- cold factories such as `Flow.Task.fromCold` and `Flow.Task.fromColdResult`
- already-created task values such as `Flow.Task.fromHot` and `Flow.Task.fromHotResult`

Use cold task helpers when work should start at flow execution time.

Use hot task helpers only when you already have a task value on purpose.

`ColdTask<'value>` binds directly in `flow {}`. `ColdTask<Result<'value, 'error>>` stays
explicit through `Flow.Task.fromColdResult` so result-shaped cold task functions do not create
ambiguous builder behavior.

## Retry Attempts

`RetryPolicy.MaxAttempts` counts total attempts, including the first run.

So:

- `MaxAttempts = 1` means "run once, never retry"
- `MaxAttempts = 3` means "initial run plus up to two retries"

## What The Tests Cover

The test suite currently verifies:

- direct binding from `Result`, `Async`, `Async<Result<_,_>>`, `Task`, and `ColdTask`
- cancellation token propagation into task factories
- timeout behavior
- retry attempt counting
- sync and async disposal through builder `use` / `use!`
- explicit release on cancellation through `useWithAcquireRelease`
- exception capture across synchronous and asynchronous boundaries
