Write asynchronous F# workflows whose expected failures and required dependencies are visible in their types.

> Axial is pre-1.0 and its API may change before the first stable release.

## Your first flow

A handler usually needs services and can fail, but a `Task` signature shows neither fact. `Flow<'env, 'error, 'value>`
makes both part of the contract.

```fsharp
open Axial

type CheckoutError =
    | OrderNotFound of orderId: int
    | PaymentDeclined of reason: string

type Receipt = { OrderId: int; Total: decimal; Reference: string }

type CheckoutEnv =
    { FindTotal: int -> ColdTask<Result<decimal, CheckoutError>>
      Charge: decimal -> ColdTask<Result<string, CheckoutError>> }

let checkout orderId : Flow<CheckoutEnv, CheckoutError, Receipt> =
    flow {
        let! findTotal = Flow.envWith _.FindTotal
        let! charge = Flow.envWith _.Charge
        let! total = findTotal orderId
        let! reference = charge total
        return { OrderId = orderId; Total = total; Reference = reference }
    }
```

The application supplies live functions. A test supplies a record of fakes. The workflow does not change.

Adding a timeout, a retry policy, and a resource that must be released does not change the signature either, because
the runtime that starts the workflow owns cancellation, retries, and cleanup:

```fsharp
open System

let checkoutOrder orderId : Flow<CheckoutEnv, CheckoutError, Receipt> =
    checkout orderId
    |> Flow.Runtime.retry (RetryPolicy.noDelay 3)
    |> Flow.Runtime.timeout (TimeSpan.FromSeconds 5.0) (PaymentDeclined "checkout timed out")
```

Flow also carries concurrency, scheduling, streams, and structured child fibers through the same runtime.

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package Axial
```

## Package family

- [`Axial`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Axial) — the core workflow model: typed failures, dependencies, concurrency, resources, schedules, streams, and layers.
- [`Axial.Process`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Axial.Process) — external process composition, pipelines, streaming output, typed failures, cancellation, and cleanup.
- [`Axial.HttpClient`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Axial.HttpClient) — typed HTTP requests, response handling, and reliability policies.

Supporting packages provide platform services, console and file-system access, hosting, and telemetry. The [package catalogue](https://adz.github.io/Axial/packages/) links the first-class libraries and the complete compatibility matrix.

## Reified integration

[Reified](https://github.com/adz/Reified) declares value, model, JSON, and HTTP contracts. Axial's optional server adapters execute Reified HTTP contracts as workflows; neither core depends on the other.

Declare a contract with Reified. Serve it with Axial.
